# propulsion_subsystem_haifuraiya
# Introduction

This Open Research Institute Phase4SPace project repo will be used to develop the proposed Haifuraiya (Japanese:  ハイフライヤー English: High-Flyer) propulsion subsystem for a future HEO mission SmallSat. The repo was created on 8/28/2022.

# Summary

In July/August 2022 the ORI community discussed formalizing a concept for a High Energy Orbit (HEO) 'flyer' satellite, that would have its own propulsion system. The background for the Haifuraiya name and the overall initial concept derivation/top-level goals was discussed at length and is recorded[^1] and its predecessor concept by Jan King W3GEY is directly available[^2].

# Special Notes

By special arrangement with its inventor/develpoer, ORI is making available in this repository a public copy of the entire flight hardware designs/firmware build knowledge-base including a comprehensive technical, scientific and industrial documentation set of [The George Washington University][100] [Micro-propulsion and Nanotechnology Laboratory][99]'s successful 2014-2015 BRICSAT-P (US Naval Academy/George Washington University) and 2014-2018 Canyval-X (Yonsei University/NASA GSFC/George Washington University) CubeSat quad-channel electric rocket system as provided in 2015 to NASA, on the condition that it is only used for study/research/experimentation/academic and scientific missions, and no commercial development is allowed. Parts of the technology have been patented (US Patent 10006445) and is available for licensing from The George Washington University. 

The knowledge-base is available [here][101]

If you choose to view/utilize the references (Approximately *3.14GB, 3525 files*), you are advised the knowledge-base contains copyrighted code, and information that was and still could be of a propietary nature thus may have more restrictive licenses than the license under which ORI has organized this repository. Your are restricted from disseminating this repository without the exact same restrictions you are being asked to follow. *While ORI has assurances the information will be able to be replicated (to build ground/engineering/flight hardware) with current production COTS parts -  there is no technical support provided, and all questions are to be redirected to the inventor/developer directly. Contact ORI for further details.*
