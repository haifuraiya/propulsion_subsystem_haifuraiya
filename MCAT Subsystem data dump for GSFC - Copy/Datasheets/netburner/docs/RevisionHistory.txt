Release22_RC3
 Features
    * DHCP renew fix


Release22_RC2
 New Features
    * Added Fast RAM feature. This feature uses on-chip fast static ram for RTOS stacks, variables and network buffers. This should improve task switching, interrupt latency and network performance. In most applications it will improve performance by 50%. This feature is on by default. If you are using on-chip SRAM for your own purposes, you will need to disable this feature in \nburn\include\constants.h.
    * Added support for Email MIME attachments as text or binary, and associated examples.
    * Added a build status report each time NBEclipse builds a project that shows flash usage, ram usage and the tools revision number.
    * Added ability to name uC/OS tasks, and names are now supported by Task Scan, Smart Traps and the NBEclipse debugger. The new function are:
          o BYTE OSTaskCreatewName( void ( *task ) ( void *dptr ),
          o void *data,
          o void *pstktop,
          o void *pstkbot,
          o BYTE prio, const char * name);
          o OSSimpleTaskCreatewName( void( *task ) (void *dprt ),
          o BYTE priority,
          o const char *name )
 Example Programs
    * Reorganized the c:\nburn\examples directory to group examples by function, such
    as TCP, Serial, FTP, etc.
    * Changed web page image in PK70 factory example from mod-dev-100 to PK70.
    * Added FlashDemo example to \nburn\examples\Mod5270, Mod5234 and Mod5282.
    * Added Email attachment examples in \nburn\examples\Email .
    * Added RTOS examples from Programmers Guide to \nburn\examples\RTOS.
    * Added ChangeIP example from Programmers Guide to \nburn\examples.
    * Added DNS Device Name example.
    * Added DNS example.
    * Added TCP examples for clients, multiple sockets and use of the select() function to \nburn\examples\TCP.
    * All web page related examples moved to \nburn\examples\web. Embedded Flash File System
    * Added command parser options to the example EFFS_HTTP to allow SD card formatting and usage reports using MTTTY and the serial port.
 Documentation
    * Updated the MCF5272 Freescale Reference Manual to the latest revision.
    * Added Sendmail attachment function calls.
    * Added schematic for revision 1.09 mod-dev-100 development board. Hardware
    * Support for the MOD-DEV-70 development board with the MOD5234 has been added. "ioboard.c" is removed and replaced with "ioboard.cpp", with changes made to the "makefile" to take this into account. This change in file extension is required in order to include support for C++-specific syntax used by the ETPU system files, and the if-else condition abbreviation statements.
    * Support for the MOD-DEV-70 development board with the MOD5282 has been added. "ioboard.c" is removed and replaced with "ioboard.cpp", with changes made to the "makefile" to take this into account. This change in file extension is required in order to include support for C++-specific syntax used by the if-else condition abbreviation statements.
    * Follow-up on MOD5234/82 compatibility with MOD-DEV-70 development board: Comments have been added near the top of each platform's ioboard.cpp file to indicate what pins are being used for getdipsw() and putleds(), and the cautions of using the pins for a custom application while calling the two functions mentioned.
    * Added support for new NXP Real Time Clock used on mod-dev-70 and mod-dev-100 new revision development boards. The previous RTC has been discontinued by the manufacturer.
 Software
    * FTP Client and Server Compatibility Change. The definition of FTP_OK and FTP_FAIL were different for the FTP Client and FTP Server. All references to FTP_OK and FTP_FAIL used in FTP Server functions (denoted by FTPD in function names and file names) have been changed to FTPD_OK and FTPD_FAIL in the following files: \nburn\include\ftpd.h, \nburn\system\ftpd.cpp and \nburn\examples\effs\effs-http\fat_f.cpp. If you have an application based on the EFFS-HTTP or EFFS-FTP example code that uses ftp_f.cpp, you will need to replace FTP_OK and FTP_FAIL with FTPD_OK and FTPD_FAIL.
    * The GatherRandom function used by SSL had a bug in that corruption could occur for multiple interrupts. This has been corrected.
    * The TCP SockReadWithTimeout( ) function had an error where it could get stuck in an infinite loop when TCP was stressed with a half-open denial-of-service attack. This has been corrected.
    * Fixed stream update functions used by EFFS update, HTTP update and TCP update for PK70 platform.
    * Added gratuitous ARP function.
    * Fixed DHCP Renew to include the device name with the renew request.
    * Removed leading whitespace in FTP server functions that list file names. This had prevented some FTP Clients from properly displaying the file names.
    * Fixed a bug in passive mode FTP that could prevent some connections through firewalls.
    * Fixed problem with writesafestring() and writeallsafestring() functions in which the last character was not written.
    * Fixed problem with the HTTP password function in that caused erratic behavior when HTTP reserved characters were used.
    * Added return error code when OSTaskCreate( ) is called and no more task control blocks are available.
    * Added extern function prototype declaration for GetPreciseTime(). With this function call, one can use a higher resolution time tick than the default "TimeTick" on the MOD5234, MOD5270, and MOD5282. Resolutions are ~0x.868 microseconds per tick for the MOD5234 and MOD5270, and ~1.929 microseconds per tick for the MOD5282.
    * Upgraded EFFS to version 3.3.1, which adds SDHC support for SD cards larger than 2GB.
    * Fixed I2C to recover when address is not acknowledged with the SendBuf and ReadBuf functions. BasePutChar() has been modified to test whether the member function WriteData() wrote a character to the buffer successfully or not. In the event that WriteData() was not successful, SetDataAvail() would be called anyways to indicate that the file descriptor has available data in the pool buffer for reading, when it really does not. This would cause the select() function in serreadwto() to indicate there is data available, while the member function ReadData() will always return '0', causing an endless while loop.
    * Modified SerialClose( ) to reset the buffer FIFO instead of calling init to correct a possible memory leak.
    * Fixed outgoing ARP problems when running the debug Ethernet driver. This would affect debug builds in which the NetBurner device was making an outgoing connection to a computer other than the on used for debug.
    * Added drivers and examples for new PK70 blade boards.
